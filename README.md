## RULES

And now for something completely different: if you've been following along, you know that we have a copy of https://amzn.to/2DSUtbJ that we're obligated to give away. We've determined the best mechanism for doing so, but do not have access to cattle nor a catapult of suitable size.

So we've decided on a different set of rules:

1. Friends & Family of this page's admins are preemptively disqualified. The admins, too (sorry!) They will not be sacked, however, as they are not regaling us with stories of moose. Oh, who are we kidding? There's only one admin, and he's already managed to snag a free copy, so there's no point in awarding himself the giveaway copy!

2. We'll cover shipping in the continental United States, but not elsewhere on this little rock we call home. It's not that we don't love our followers in Mauritius, it's that we're altogether too cheap and stingy to ship there on our dime. Also, we have no idea if we have any Mauritian fans. Pretty sure there's a Martian fan, or at least a guy who paints himself green and pretends to be a Martian. If the selected winner happens to live abroad, we will contact them to see if they are willing to cover shipping. If they are in the continental US, we'll contact them to get their mailing address. If they are unwilling to pay shipping or provide their address, we will proceed to the runner up, repeating as necessary until we learn that all our followers are foreign or paranoid, and we end up just dropping the book into the hands of the nearest uncultured hillbilly we can find.

3. The deadline for entry is before I look at your answers on the first day of November, 2018. Now, I'm a huge Halloween fan, so it may be fairly late in the day, or I may even forget to look upon that day. I won't choose the winner before then, but I'm also not going to commit to a ridiculous time like 2018-11-01T00:00:00Z, because I may be a bit hungover.

4. The manner of winning: we have selected several quotes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail and created a specific ordering of those quotes. In order to enter the contest, share this post, and comment on _THIS_ post (not one of the shared versions - the original!) with the quote you think is our favorite. The first person to have shared this post and commented with the quote highest in our list (which we will publish in a manner that shows we had the list prior to sharing this post) shall be the winner. Not the fourth person; the fifth is right out. In the event that nobody guesses any of the quotes in our list, we shall number all of the comments and then use either a random number generator, or the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, whichever is more readily available, to select the winner at random.

5. The admin is the sole arbiter of any disputes that may arise from this contest, and shall be the sole judge regarding who wins. You are not entitled to anything from us. If you don't win, don't wine. If we screw up and get the wrong person, well, it's entirely unintentional, so piss off! We have been eating a lot of Mexican food of late, and are more than capable of farting in your general direction should you create a big fuss. We hereby expressly deny any and all liability.
